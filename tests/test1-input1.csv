The interpretation of these sounds is a difficult skill to acquire. In this work we have developed an application to detect, monitor, and analyze the split in second heart sound (S2) using a smart phone. The application records the heartbeat using a stethoscope connected to the smart phone. The audio signal is converted into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform to detect the first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2). S2 is extracted and fed into the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and then to Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to detect the Aortic (A2) and the Pulmonic (P2) components, which are used to calculate the split in S2. With our application, users can continuously monitor their second heart sound irrespective of ages and check for a split in their hearts with a low-cost, easily available equipment.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944050","","Heart;Continuous wavelet transforms;Monitoring;Discrete wavelet transforms;Biomedical monitoring","acoustic signal processing;biomedical equipment;cardiology;discrete wavelet transforms;fast Fourier transforms;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;smart phones","smart phone monitoring;second heart sound split;heart auscultation;cardiac diagnosis;heartbeat recording;stethoscope;frequency domain;fast Fourier transform;discrete wavelet transform;continuous wavelet transform;aortic component;pulmonic component","Aortic Valve;Cell Phone;Fourier Analysis;Heart Sounds;Humans;Monitoring, Physiologic;Phonocardiography;Pulmonary Valve;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Wavelet Analysis","3","12","","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the basis of a small qualitative study of reactions by employees to having their workplace monitored by networked sensors, we offer three guidelines to help ensure that smart office IoT initiatives incorporate a broader set of values and beneficiaries. We suggest that environmental monitoring in the workplace can create more value for `users' and reduce the risk of adverse reactions if employees are more actively involved in the design and communication process.","","978-1-78561-843-7","10.1049/cp.2018.0021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8379708","smart office;internet of things;co-design;occupancy monitoring;acceptability","","ergonomics;Internet;Internet of Things;personnel","workplace;adverse reactions;employees;participatory IoT monitoring;user experience;networked sensors;smart office IoT initiatives;environmental monitoring;design process;communication process;Internet of Things","","","","","14 Jun 2018","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, at current stage, such performance monitor systems for the virtualized systems are inadequate and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a lightweight performance monitor system model for virtual machines, called PMonitor. Through prototype implementation and experiments, we find that PMonitor consumes very few processing power, which is much lower than other open source performance monitors running on the virtualized environments.","","978-1-4244-3581-4","10.1109/ETCS.2009.688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959406","virtual machine;lightweight;performance monitor","Condition monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Measurement;Performance gain;System performance;Resource management;Power system management;Power system modeling;Virtual prototyping","virtual machines","lightweight performance monitor;virtual machines;system performance evaluation","","1","9","","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is assumed that these system support employees in their daily routine and reduce mental demand and stress at work. However, context-aware systems entail the potential for comprehensive electronic workplace monitoring. This contribution reviews the influence of electronic monitoring on outcome variables, such as performance, psychological stress and strain, work motivation, satisfaction and behavior. 85 studies have been identified and prepared both qualitatively and metaanalytically. There were heterogeneous findings for employee performance. Mild adverse effects of monitoring on perceived stress, mental demand, job motivation and satisfaction, as well as organizational trust and perceived control could be found. Significant design recommendations were made in order to increase acceptance and avoid adverse monitoring effects. Most of the studies were based on cross-sectional correlative or quasi-experimental survey designs. As a result, ascertained design knowledge requires more longitudinal studies and systematic interventions of electronic monitoring in the field.","2474-2325","978-1-5386-3615-2","10.1109/SII.2019.8700354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8700354","context sensitivity;electronic monitoring;human-machine interaction;psychological demands;review","Employment;Stress;Task analysis;Occupational safety;Surveillance;Psychology","human resource management;man-machine systems;organisational aspects;personnel;psychology","electronic employee monitoring;context-aware systems;work motivation;context sensitive technologies;mental demand reduction;work stress;electronic workplace monitoring;psychological stress-strain;organizational trust;job satisfaction;quasiexperimental survey designs;human-machine interaction","","","45","","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
