J	Zhao, D. C.; Lin, F.								Dual-detector electronic monitoring of electron beam selective melting								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY				289						116935	10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2020.116935			MAR 2021	2021	Electron Beam Selective Melting (EBSM) is an advanced additive manufacturing technique used in many vital industrial fields. However, the lack of process monitoring and quality control is largely restricting the industrial application. The optical-based monitoring methods are hindered by the complex working conditions, such as intensive radiation, elevated temperature, and severe evaporation. Electronic imaging is an alternative monitoring technique which has been introduced into EBSM process. However, the correlation between the electronic signal and topographic features has not been identified. In this study, a dual-detector electronic imaging system was presented for in-situ monitoring of EBSM process. The preliminary experiment shows a linear correlation between the electronic current and surface height gradient, suggesting a sensitive response of the electronic imaging system to surface height variation. In-situ experiment indicates that the electronic imaging system is capable of visualizing the deposited surfaces with plentiful contrasts. Signal fusion between the dual detectors was able to separate the mixed contrasts for identifying various defects, such as pores and fluctuations. The correlation between signal and topography indicates a good potential for in-situ surface reconstruction and in-process quality control during EBSM process.		[Zhao, D.

J	Rispler, Clara; Luria, Gil								Employee experience and perceptions of an organizational road-safety intervention - A mixed-methods study								SAFETY SCIENCE				134						105089	10.1016/j.ssci.2020.105089			FEB 2021	2021	Phone use while driving is a common cause of road casualties. This study examines whether organizational influence can be leveraged to reduce employees' phone use at the wheel. It explores employees' views on a "nophone-use-while-driving" road safety organizational intervention. Forty-five employees from six different organizations completed a four-month no-phone use-while-driving Organizational Health and Safety (OHS) intervention. Quantitative data on organizational safety climate and safety motivation were gathered through a survey, and a smartphone monitoring application provided objective data on the number of times the driver touched the phone screen while driving. Employees' experiences and perceptions of the intervention and its impact were measured qualitatively through interviews. Content analysis of the interview data provided insights into the impact of the intervention on participants, how the organization influenced the intervention, and where participants perceived the locus of control over their behavior (internally or externally). A mixed-methods analysis showed that employees who perceived the organizational safety climate as higher saw the workplace as a reliable means of promoting a safety program. Participants who frequently spoke in terms of an internal locus of control had higher safety motivation, and were more likely to reduce the degree to which they touched the screen while driving. Organizational safety climate and safety motivation have a positive role in predicting participation in a safety intervention within an organizational setting, and in promoting the desired behavior change. These findings can help organizations better manage their safety intervention programs and improve employees' safety performance.

Optical Performance Monitoring in Mode Division Multiplexed Optical Networks								JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY				39	2			491	504		10.1109/JLT.2020.3027725			JAN 15 2021	2021	This article considers, for the first time, optical performance monitoring (OPM) in few mode fiber (FMF)-based optical networks. 1-D features vector, extracted by projecting a 2-D asynchronous in-phase quadrature histogram (IQH), and the 2D IQH are proposed to achieve OPM in FMF-based network. Three machine learning algorithms are employed for OPM and their performances are compared. These include support vector machine, random forest algorithm, and convolutional neural network. Extensive simulations are conducted to monitor optical to signal ratio (OSNR), chromatic dispersion (CD), and mode coupling (MC) for dual polarization-quadrature phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) at 10, 12, 16, 20, and 28 Gbaud transmission speeds. Besides, M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M = 8 and 16) is considered. Also, the OPM accuracy is investigated under different FMF channel conditions including phase noise and polarization mode dispersion. Simulation results show that the proposed 1D projection features vector provides better OPM results than those of the widely used asynchronous amplitude histogram (AAH) features. Furthermore, it has been found that the 2D IQH features outperform the 1D projection features but require larger number of features samples. Additionally, the effect of fiber nonlinearity on the OPM accuracy is investigated. Finally, OPM using the 2D IQH features has been verified experimentally for 10 Gbaud DP-QPSK signal. The obtained results show a good agreement between both simulation and experimental findings.

J	Samuchiwal, Saurabh; Gola, Deepak; Malik, Anushree								Decolourization of textile effluent using native microbial consortium enriched from textile industry effluent								JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS				402						123835	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123835			JAN 15 2021	2021	A robust and efficient treatment process is required to address the problem of residual colour and avoid expensive post-treatment steps while dealing with textile effluents. In the present work, a novel microbial consortium enriched from textile effluent was used to optimize the process of decolourization under extreme conditions with minimum inputs. With PreTreatment Range (PTR) effluent as a carbon source and only 0.5 g/L yeast extract as external input, the process enabled 70-73% colour reduction (from 1910-1930 to 516-555 hazen) in dyeing unit wastewater. Unhindered performance at higher temperatures (30 degrees C-50 degrees C) and wide pH range (7-12) makes this process highly suitable for the treatment of warm and extremely alkaline textile effluents. No significant difference was observed in the decolourization efficiency for effluents from different batches (Colour: 1647-4307 hazen; pH-11.5-12.0) despite wide variation in nature and concentration of dyes employed. Long term (60 days) continuous mode performance monitoring at hydraulic retention time of 48 h in lab-scale bioreactor showed consistent colour (from 1734-1980 to 545-723 hazen) and chemical oxygen demand (1720-2170 to 669-844 mg/L) removal and consistently neutral pH of the treated water. Present study thus makes a significant contribution by uncovering the ability of native microbial consortium to reliably treat dye laden textile wastewater without any dilution or pre-treatment and with minimum external inputs. The results ensure easy applicability of this indigenously developed process at the industrial scale.

J	Shao, Qian								Comparative study of wireless sensors for measuring the energy consumption of human running								MEASUREMENT				168						108382	10.1016/j.measurement.2020.108382			JAN 15 2021	2021	With the rapid development of technologies such as communications, embedded computing, and sensors, wireless sensor network technology has become more mature and its applications have become more and more extensive. The development of technology has brought great convenience to people's lives and work. At the same time, people's activity and exercise are greatly reduced, causing health problems such as physical weakness. In this regard, designing a research based on wireless sensors to measure human walking and running is of great significance to promote the development of people's physical health. This paper presents a design scheme for human exercise energy consumption detection, researches and designs the coordinator, router node and host computer monitoring system of wireless sensor network. In the human motion energy consumption detection system implemented in this paper, the communication effect between the coordinator and the router node is good, and there are fewer problems such as node loss and data loss. The host computer monitoring interface is simple and easy to operate, easy to use, and can run stably. This solution does not need wiring, reduces the point of failure, reduces the cost, and has good scalability, laying a foundation for the further development of the human motion detection system, and has a wide range of application prospects and practical values. This paper is based on two constant beam width algorithms to carry out the experimental research on the energy consumption of human walking and running, and analyze the results of the energy consumption experiment. Experimental results show that the two constant beamwidth beamforming algorithms have relatively good constant beamwidth effect, which basically verifies the correctness of the theoretical analysis results and can be applied to target noise measurement.

J	Abane, Juliana Abagsonema; Brenya, Edward								The relationship between organizational environment antecedents and performance management in local government: evidence from Ghana								FUTURE BUSINESS JOURNAL				7	1					3	10.1186/s43093-020-00049-2			JAN 12 2021	2021	The study aimed to investigate the relationship between organizational environment antecedents and their impact on performance management among local government authorities and to further understand the role of the stakeholder and political support in the performance monitoring and review of local governments. The study used quantitative research design techniques in the data collection phase between May and August 2017 in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. The sample included 850 middle level and senior managers of the Local Government Service. Multiple regression was used to analyze the data. The results of the findings indicate that there is a strong relationship between two organizational environment variables: "stakeholder participation", political support, and performance management providing a variance of 31.8 percent of the changes in the dependent variable. However, the findings further suggest that stakeholder participation was a better predictor of performance management than political support. Additionally, employees' age, gender, and organizational size were statistically significant in the model fit. This study is one of the first of its kind to link two organizational environment indicators (stakeholder support and political support) and their effect on two performance management dimensions (performance monitoring and evaluation, and performance review). Also, few studies have used the structural contingency theory in explaining the influence of the environment on internal business processes of organizations in the performance management literature.

J	Frampton, Jessica R.; Fox, Jesse								Monitoring, Creeping, or Surveillance? A Synthesis of Online Social Information Seeking Concepts								REVIEW OF COMMUNICATION RESEARCH				9				1	42		10.12840/ISSN.2255-4165.025			2021	2021	Affordances of Internet sites and Internet-based applications make personal information about romantic partners, friends, family members, and strangers easy to obtain. People use various techniques to find information about others, capitalizing on online affordances by using search engines to find relevant websites and databases; scouring the target's social media or social networking site presence; accessing information about the target via their links or network association with others on social media; or asking questions or crowdsourcing information through online channels. Researchers have coined an assortment of terms to describe online social information seeking behaviors, such as interpersonal electronic surveillance, social surveillance, monitoring, patient-targeted Googling, cybervetting, websleuthing, human flesh search, lateral surveillance, Facebook surveillance, and Facebook stalking. Although considerable research has examined these behaviors, there has been little effort to clarify the concepts themselves. As a result, the literature is currently full of inconsistent and overlapping conceptualizations. To synthesize these concepts for future research, this review examines 73 online social information seeking concepts extracted from 186 articles. Specifically, the concepts are reviewed in light of their scope; the information seeker or target of information seeking (e.g., romantic partners, parents, children, employees, criminals); motives for information seeking (e.g., uncertainty, threat, curiosity); and the intensity of the behavior. Recommendations are provided for future research, such as employing clear conceptualizations and incorporating affordances. Finally, we offer a decision tree that researchers can use to help select appropriate terms to use in their work moving forward.

It provides a single-element 650-kHz transducer design and a straightforward control mechanism, with extensive calibration and internal electronic monitoring to prevent unwanted over or under treatment. One goal of this approach is to relieve researchers of many of the details associated with developing their own exposure equipment. A unique transducer positioning system and distinctive MRI fiducial targets simplify alignment and targeting. The system design, control software, calibration, and alignment techniques are described in detail. Examples of transducer targeting and neurostimulation using the system are provided.

The main purpose of the inspection robot is to carry out inspection, prevention, reporting, and safety emergency operation on the instruments, so as to provide guarantee for the safe operation of the nuclear power plant. Based on the representative configuration of nuclear power robot at home and abroad, this paper develops a small and lightweight nuclear power plant inspection robot, including walking mechanism, lifting mechanism, operating mechanism, image acquisition, information communication and control system, etc., to carry on the statics analysis to the key components of the inspection robot and verify that the stiffness and strength of the mechanical structure meet the requirements of lightweight design. Modal analysis is carried out to verify that the motor does not cause resonance when working. The kinematic model of the robot has been established and can provide the theoretical basis for the controller design. A hierarchical control system based on LabVIEW upper computer monitoring and control operation interface is established, which uses adaptive fuzzy Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control to simulate the walking control, and then realizes the control of walking mechanism through software programming, and the adaptive fuzzy PID control has better effect than the conventional PID control. The S-type acceleration and deceleration algorithm is used to realize the accurate control of the position location of the lifting mechanism. Finally, combined with the experiment of 5MS robot comprehensive experimental platform, it is proved that the inspection robot can realize remote control function operation.

J	Karamichailidou, Despina; Kaloutsa, Vasiliki; Alexandridis, Alex								Wind turbine power curve modeling using radial basis function neural networks and tabu search								RENEWABLE ENERGY				163				2137	2152		10.1016/j.renene.2020.10.020			JAN 2021	2021	Wind turbine power curve (WTPC) modeling is of great importance for performance monitoring. This work proposes a new method for producing highly accurate non-parametric models for wind turbines based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). To achieve this, we employ networks belonging to the radial basis function (RBF) architecture, and feed them with additional important input variables besides wind speed. To further increase modeling accuracy, while at the same time keeping the computational cost at acceptable levels, we introduce a new training algorithm based on the successful non-symmetric fuzzy means (NSFM) approach, which in this work is hybridized with the tabu search (TS) metaheuristic technique, enabling the method to train efficiently datasets of high dimensionality. The resulting method is evaluated on real data from four wind turbines, whereas a comparison with numerous WTPC modeling schemes, including parametric and non-parametric models is conducted. The solution found by the proposed algorithm outperforms the results produced by its rivals in terms of both modeling accuracy and efficiency, while in most cases it also leads to simpler models. The resulting models can be used successfully, not only for accurate WTPC modeling, but also for constructing wind turbine performance analysis tools, e.g. 3-D power curves. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
